# Parallel_Processing_Data-Engineering

In this guided project, I expand on my acquired knowledge regarding parallel processing by building a MapReduce like framework to help execute mapper and reducer functions on chunks of data in parallel with one another. The data that we will be using from this project, are wiki pages that are saved in html syntax. The task of this project is to utilize the Map Reduce framework to search through each file , line by line to process and identify lines of data that match a string. This projects helps identify the importance of reviewing case sensitive and case insensitive data when searching and analyzing string related data.

Python Modules used: Pandas, csv, functools, itertools and multiprocessing.
